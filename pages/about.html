      <!--Description for the Grad Show-->
      <p>
        The ANU School Art & Design 2024 Graduating Exhibition showcases the work of students completing undergraduate, <br>
        honours and postgraduate coursework programs at the Australian National University School of Art & Design. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        This year, we are proud to present over fifty graduating students, working across a wide range of creative forms. <br>
        The changing complexion of our Graduating Exhibition reflects changes within the School: our increasingly flexible <br>
        Visual Arts program encourages students to create their own path, developing the unique practices on show in this <br>
        exhibition. In Design, students work on applied, collaborative creative projects, engaging as you will see with a <br>
        wide range of challenges and contexts.  Through what has been a challenging period for many, we celebrate the resilience, <br>
        inventiveness and agency of our graduating students. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This exhibition also reflects the tireless work of the School’s academic and professional staff. I’d like to specifically <br>
        thank Dr Peter Alwast, Master of Contemporary Art Practices Convenor; Dr Ella Barclay, Visual Arts Honours Convenor;  <br>
        Dr Pia van Gelder, Bachelor of Design Convenor;  Dr Naomi Hay, Bachelor of Design (Honours) Convenor; and Dr Rebecca Mayo, <br>
        Bachelor of Visual Arts Convenor. I’d also like to acknowledge third year coursework leaders Lucy Irvine and Dr Naomi Hay <br>
        as well as our School Manager, Suzanne Knight, in leading the School’s technical and professional teams that work behind <br>
        the scenes to make it all possible. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Special acknowledgement for producing the exhibition goes to the School of Art & Design Gallery staff, led by Senior Gallery <br>
        Coordinator Megan Hinton with Irina Agaronyan and Adina West; lead curator Lucy Irvine; and the School’s technical team, led <br>
        by Emma Beer, who were invaluable in making this exhibition a physical reality. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I would also like to gratefully acknowledge the patrons of our Emerging Artists Support Scheme (EASS) and the ANU Visual Arts <br>
        Endowment, who continue to support our graduating students through an array of prizes, scholarships and awards. As well as <br>
        rewarding excellence, these prizes provide important opportunities for students to develop their creative practice in the wider world. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Congratulations to all our graduates on reaching this important milestone; we celebrate your success, and we look forward to <br>
        seeing how you shape your own creative paths in the years to come. <br>
      </p>
