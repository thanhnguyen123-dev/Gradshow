        <p>
          Approaching my practice with a sense of curiosity and play, my work navigates relationships
          to place during a time of rapid environmental change. Incorporating found waste materials
          from industrial process, I use experimental ceramic processes to respond to places of
          anthropogenic intervention.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my process, I visit and revisit building sites around my local area on Ngunnawal/Ngambri land.
          Stratified and unearthed evidence of human relationships with environment are revealed through the
          industrial processes that take place there. Rock, clay, and debris I collect from these sites are
          combined with industrial waste products and commercial materials. Drawing on my experience of places
          visited, I look to interaction between material and process, letting the unexpected results guide my making.
        </p>
        <p>
          The forms that emerge reflect the competing and coalescing human and environmental energy present in the sites
          visited. For me, my work becomes a stilled repository of this point in time and place. From this point, I can
          reconcile with tensions in our ecologies and imagine ongoing relationships with environments and place in flux.
