        Approaching my practice with a sense of curiosity and play, my work navigates relationships to place during a time of rapid environmental change. Incorporating found waste materials 
        from industrial process, I use experimental ceramic processes to respond to places of anthropogenic intervention.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my process, I visit and revisit building sites around my local area on Ngunnawal/Ngambri land. Stratified and unearthed evidence of human relationships with environment are revealed through the industrial processes that take place there. Rock, clay, and debris I collect from these sites are combined with industrial waste products and commercial materials. Drawing on my experience of places visited, I look to interaction between material and process, letting the unexpected results guide my making. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The forms that emerge reflect the competing and coalescing human and environmental energy present in the sites visited. For me, my work becomes a stilled repository of this point in time and place. From this point, I can reconcile with tensions in our ecologies and imagine ongoing relationships with environments and place in flux.
