      <!--Description of the artwork-->
      <p>
        My work explores complex relationships between body, space, and place. The photos have been deconstructed <br>
        to alter the functional significance of each chosen place. In removing most of the context, the sole subject <br>
        becomes the people; the way people behave, move and hold their bodies in a given space. This leads to questions <br>
        about the value of particular places, when our intentions are to record our experience rather than being fully <br>
        present where we are. I hope to prompt the viewer to reflect on their own occupation of public space, including <br>
        this very installation. Everyone will have various intimate and past experiences dictating how they will encounter <br> 
        this artwork yet, at this moment in time, it is a space that can be collectively shared.
