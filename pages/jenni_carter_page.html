      <p>
        For me, art is a way to communicate. As someone with ADHD and ASD, sometimes it is difficult <br>
        to put things into words, making it hard to let others know what I am struggling with. I find <br>
        it easier to use metaphors or to draw something and say thatâ€™s what I am feeling. For this piece, <br>
        I wanted to create a collection of experiences and ideas, assembling a sense of a whole from disparate <br>
        pieces of paper, canvas, leather and plastic. Some of the images and texts reflect my own experience <br>
        and others represent how people around me, who have similar diagnoses, feel in the world. I have colour-coded <br>
        and redefined terms to help the viewer relate to the work and reflect back upon their own experiences.<br>
