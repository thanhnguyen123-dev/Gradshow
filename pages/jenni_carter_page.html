        For me, art is a way to communicate. As someone with ADHD and ASD, sometimes it is difficult to put things into words, making it hard to let others know what I am struggling with. I find it easier to use metaphors or to draw something and say thatâ€™s what I am feeling. For this piece, I wanted to create a collection of experiences and ideas, assembling a sense of a whole from disparate pieces of paper, canvas, leather and plastic. Some of the images and texts reflect my own experience and others represent how people around me, who have similar diagnoses, feel in the world. I have colour-coded and redefined terms to help the viewer relate to the work and reflect back upon their own experiences.
