      <!--Description of the artwork-->
      <p>
        Maximum Contact: Anti-Tractatus explores theories surrounding language and the fallibility of text <br>
        as an accurate signifier of complex human experience and emotion. My visual language, emerging out <br>
        of an organic, unrestrained automatism, plays on found and recycled objects and materials. Spontaneous <br>
        subconscious dialogues dictate the direction of the mark making and the production of personal symbols. <br>
        These abstracted symbols are evocative of text, however they do not translate to any fixed meaning. The <br>
        tension of impossible interpretation seeks to excavate the need for defined understanding, and instead <br>
        invite reflection of subconscious and often suppressed reactions to art and life. The received aesthetics <br>
        of domestic and urban detritus carry these subjective semiotics to birth a space which collapses passive 
        and conventional experiences of art.
