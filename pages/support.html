      <h2>Emerging Artist Support Scheme</h2>
      <p>
        The Emerging Artists Support Scheme (EASS) is an institution at the ANU School of Art & Design,
        founded by in 1988 by the then Director, David Willams. From modest beginnings, EASS has
        continued to grow over the past three decades and boasts the strong support of our wonderful
        community of arts patrons: individuals, businesses, galleries and organisations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patrons of the Scheme support our undergraduate and postgraduate students by offering a variety
        of awards, and commissioning and acquiring new artworks. Such generous sponsorship from patrons
        represents assistance for graduating artists when it is most valuable - at the beginning of their
        independent careers. The Emerging Artists Support Scheme offers countless opportunities for our graduates;
        bolsters the prominence of art and design in our local regions; and helps our graduates find their place
        in the national creative industries sector. The breadth and scope of the Emerging Artists Support Scheme
        is unique to the ANU School of Art & Design.
