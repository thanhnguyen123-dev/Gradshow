      <h2>Emerging Artist Support Scheme</h2>
      <p>
        The Emerging Artists Support Scheme (EASS) is an institution at the ANU School of Art & Design, <br>
        founded by in 1988 by the then Director, David Willams. From modest beginnings, EASS has <br>
        continued to grow over the past three decades and boasts the strong support of our wonderful <br>
        community of arts patrons: individuals, businesses, galleries and organisations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Patrons of the Scheme support our undergraduate and postgraduate students by offering a variety <br>
        of awards, and commissioning and acquiring new artworks. Such generous sponsorship from patrons <br>
        represents assistance for graduating artists when it is most valuable - at the beginning of their <br>
        independent careers. The Emerging Artists Support Scheme offers countless opportunities for our graduates; <br>
        bolsters the prominence of art and design in our local regions; and helps our graduates find their place <br>
        in the national creative industries sector. The breadth and scope of the Emerging Artists Support Scheme <br>
        is unique to the ANU School of Art & Design. <br>
